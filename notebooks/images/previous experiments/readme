This folder contains results from previous experiments.
The holdouts done for these experiments contained randomly chosen user interactions, using a uniform distribution with probability of 0.1.
The holdouts in new experiments contain only frequent users' last interactions in each bucket. Moreover, new buckets are also based on time intervals.
