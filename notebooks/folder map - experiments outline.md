* 10_last_examples_rec_var (**Latest experiments**) - contains notebooks with new experiments. Aiming to improve performance, the experiments provide a more permissive evaluation scheme:
    * Experiment 7 provides increased performances throughout all datasets and methods, when compared to the experiments carried for the dissertation. 
    * BPRMF is still not able to demonstrate a reasonable performance.
    * UKNN takes a lot of time to run.
* output_10_last_examples (**Latest experiments**) - output for experiments that use 10 last examples of each user, all datasets. 
* Experiments for Dissertation - contains notebooks that generated results shown in dissertation, along with other experiments from which no relevant results were obtained.
* images - folder for images generated for dissertation
* output - folder for outputs, datasets, etc.
